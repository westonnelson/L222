| LTIP-3 | OPIncubator Project #1 | Draft | Weston (westonnelson) Exosphere (@exosphereL2), Train (@layer2train) | DAO Vote to Partner with Thales Protocol and Support L2 Adoption | https://discord.gg/layer2dao | 2022-08-26
 
# Summary

This LTIP proposes to the Layer2DAO community an on-chain vote to signal support for the first OPIncupator project - Thales Protocol. The vote will be conducted via Snapshot, and signifies the first project for the OPIncubator. Thales Protocol has been identified as a project that has demonstrated leadership in the L2 space and has also demonstrated what the DAO believes has the potential of a high impact L2 project. The Proposal would entail supporting Thales with 27,500 $OP tokens and a token swap between the two DAOs, Layer2DAO, and Thales DAO, to align both protocols interests over the long-term. 

# Abstract

The L2DAO is about leadership in the Layer2 space and enabling other protocols to thrive. This vote is in alignment with the overall vision and roadmap of the several initiatives the DAO is working on, but specifically, this kickstarts the emphasis on the OPIncubator, which will work as a catalyst for onboarding more users to the Layer2 ecosystem.

# Background:

L2DAO is the Layer2DAO governance token which was [launched](https://docs.layer2dao.org/airdrop) 8 months ago. The DAO has launched several products that are starting  producing ongoing revenues, such as .L2 domain sales, LP positions, and resale commissions of the L2 early adopter NFT series, with other revenue generating projects, such as the OPIncubator, and many other sources of potential revenue in the pipeline. .L2 domains in particular have tremendous growth potential as a direct competitor to ENS, as well as Node Operation. 

# Implementation:

If LTIP-3 is approved, Layer2DAO will collaborate and support Thales Protocol to encourage their continued success by sending 27,500 $OP tokens for them to use for continue onboarding of users to L2.

Layer2DAO and Thales Protocol will execute a token swap of $25,000 USD of each protocols respective token ($L2DAO/$THALES) based on a 7 day MA price.
