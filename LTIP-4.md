| LTIP-4 | Layer2DAO creation of first subDAO | Draft | Weston (westonnelson), Exosphere (@exosphereL2), Train (@layer2train) |  A Vote On the Creation of the First L2DAO subDAO | https://discord.com/channels/929863680278016080/1016065573416861847 | 09.04.22

# Summary

This LTIP proposes to the Layer2DAO community a vote conducted on Snapshot to signal support for the first Layer2DAO subDAO. The vote will be conducted via Snapshot.

# Abstract

The L2DAO is about leadership in the Layer2 space. This means decentralizing the DAO is a key priority. This vote is in alignment with the overall vision and roadmap of many of the several initiatives the DAO is working on, but specifically, this kickstarts the emphasis of show support and foster L2 adoption, and we believe this will work as a catalyst for onboarding more users to the Layer2 ecosystem.

# Background:

L2DAO is the Layer2DAO governance token which was [launched](https://docs.layer2dao.org/airdrop) 8 months ago. The DAO has launched several products that are producing ongoing revenues, such as .L2 domain sales, LP positions, and resale commissions of the L2 early adopter NFT series, with other revenue generating projects, such as the new NFT Collection launched, and also many DAO to DAO partnerships yet to be announced...that will serve as sources of potential revenue in the pipeline. .L2 domains in particular have tremendous growth potential as a direct competitor to ENS, as well as Ethereum Node Operation. 

# Implementation:

If LTIP-4 is approved, Layer2DAO will create the subDAO the community feels is most well-aligned with the DAO's current needs and goals.
